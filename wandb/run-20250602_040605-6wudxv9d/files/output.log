Below is an instruction to modify a code file along with the code file. Apply these instructions and return the adapted code:

Instruction:
Enhance the save-project API by integrating a build process using the Idyll library. Implement a function to compile project artifacts like HTML, CSS, and JS, and merge these artifacts into the project data before saving. Ensure error handling is in place for the build process.

Code:
routes/api/save-project.js
```JavaScript
const requests = require('./requestFactory')
const data = require('../../persistence')

module.exports = function(req, res) {
  const project = req.body

  requests
    .createTree(req, project)
    .then(tree => {
      return requests.createCommit(req, project, tree.body)
    })
    .then(commit => {
      project.lastCommit = commit.body
      return requests.updateRef(req, project, commit.body)
    })
    .then(() => {
      return requests.getRepoInfo(req)
    })
    .then(info => {
      project.etag = info.headers.etag
      return data.saveProject(project)
    })
    .then(p => res.json(p))
    .catch(e => {
      res.status(500).json(e)
    })
}
